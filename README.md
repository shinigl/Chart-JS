# Interactive Data Visualization with Chart.js and Anime.js

This project demonstrates an interactive data visualization using **Chart.js** and **Anime.js**. It includes a **bar chart**, **line chart**, and **pie chart** that update dynamically every second with random data. The animations are handled using **Anime.js**, which provides smooth transitions for the charts as the data updates.

## Features:
- **Real-Time Data Updates**: The charts update every second with random data using `Math.random()`.
- **Chart Types**: Includes a bar chart for sales data, a line chart for temperature over time, and a pie chart for market share distribution.
- **Smooth Animations**: Animations are applied using **Anime.js** to fade in the charts when they are updated.

## Tech Stack:
- **Chart.js**: A powerful and easy-to-use library for creating various types of charts.
- **Anime.js**: A lightweight JavaScript library for animations, used here to create smooth transitions and effects for the charts.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the dynamic data updates and chart rendering.

## How It Works:
- **Sales Bar Chart**: Displays random sales values that change every second.
- **Temperature Line Chart**: Simulates changing temperatures at different times of the day.
- **Market Share Pie Chart**: Simulates market share distribution among different companies.
